Zeppelin ENTERS FROM THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN. HOLLOWAY SPEAKS.

HOLLOWAY

That was some of the finest shouting I’ve ever seen, Gentlemen, 
but we need more. I just received word that Parliament is under attack. 
The horde’s leader is laying siege to the seat of our government! 
Dejected pigeons aren’t enough, lads. I need these crows IRATE! 
Get Fritz's Fliers here to chase us, just like before, and we’ll make it 
to Parliament in no time!
