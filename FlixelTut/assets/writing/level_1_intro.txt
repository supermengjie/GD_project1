THE ZEPPELIN ENTERS FROM THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN.
CAPTAIN HOLLOWAY’S VOICE COMES OVER THE RADIO.

HOLLOWAY
The Horde’s made it to London, boys. Looks like the enemy’s at the gates. 
They’re too agile to use normal guns, so we’ve gotta think outside the box 
with this one. See that gramophone on the front of the ship? We can use that 
to hurl some not-so-niceties at our feathered friends on the ground. 
HQ says their egos can fly as high as they do, so something fancy’ll do nicely. 
Once you get their attention, just ram ‘em out of the sky, got it?
