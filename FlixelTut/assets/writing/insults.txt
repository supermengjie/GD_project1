You lily-liver’d birds!
You pigeon-livered gall-birds!
I am sick when I look on thee!
Poisonous bunch-backed toads!
Thy feathers are not worth plucking!
Thou art as fat as butter!
You’re unfit for any place but Hell!
You cream-faced loons!
Thou lump of foul deformity!
Thy beak out-venom’s all the worms of the Nile!
Your brain is as dry as a saltine cracker!
Avian, I hath plucked thy mother!
You loggerheaded, hedge-born harpy!
Frothy, elf-skinned flap-dragon!
Paunchy, fly-bitten pig-nut!
*INCOHERENT SCREECHING*
Damn soft-beak!
Featherbrained scoundrel!
You talon-less cowards!
Pinioned pigeon-brain!
Rank, dog-hearted coxcomb!
Crook-beaks!
You are unworthy to peck at even my father's eyes!
Pox of humanity!
Unclean bird-swine!
